## On form building
This app uses a custom fork of [django-fobi](https://github.com/datamade/django-fobi) for the Create Survey, Edit Survey, and Run Survey views. django-fobi's [documentation](https://django-fobi.readthedocs.io/en/0.13.8/) is an immensely helpful resource. Add-ons to the base are in this repo's `fobi-custom` folder, including custom plugins that draw from [`django-pldp`](https://github.com/datamade/django-pldp), our implementation of the Public Life Data Protocol.
