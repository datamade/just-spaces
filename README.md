# Just Spaces
üèï A tool from University City District and DataMade to promote better and more just public spaces

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Docker
- GDAL (for data imports)

## Running the app locally

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into your local copy.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:datamade/just-spaces.git
    cd just-spaces
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment. (We recommend using [`virtualenvwrapper`](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for working in a virtualized development environment.)

    ```bash
    mkvirtualenv -p python3 just-spaces
    ```

3. Install the Django requirements.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt
    ```

4. Copy the example local settings file to the correct location:

    ```bash
    cp just-spaces/local_settings.example.py just-spaces/local_settings.py
    ```

5. We use the [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/) via Node.js to compile frontend
   JavaScript to syntax that is cross-browser compatible. In order to avoid requiring
   a local Node.js installation, the JavaScript dev environment is containerized
   with Docker and Docker Compose. Use the `build` command to build the frontend
   dev environment container, a build process that will install NPM dependencies
   for the frontend:

    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

6. Create the database:

    ```bash
    createdb just-spaces
    ```

7. Run migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

8. Make a superuser for so that you can access the admin interface:

    ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Django should prompt you to provide a username, email, and password.

8. Initialize PLDP data:

    ```bash
    python manage.py initialize_pldp
    ```

9. Load ACS data:

    ```bash
    python manage.py import_data
    ```

10. Load templates:

    ```bash
    python manage.py import_survey_templates
    ```

11. Run the app locally!

    ```bash
    # In one shell, bundle and watch JavaScript assets
    docker-compose up

    # In another shell, run the dev server
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Navigate to http://localhost:8000/.

## Importing new ACS data

If you'd like to refresh ACS data, there are a few steps you'll need to take:

0. If your database is running in production, [make a backup of it with `pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup.html) just in case
1. Follow [the instructions in the `data` repo](./data/README.md#updating-data-for-a-new-year) to remake ACS data for a new year
2. Rerun `python manage.py import_data`

The `import_data` management command will update data if it already exists, so you shouldn't experience data loss during import. Still, we recommend that you practice caution and make a backup.

## Permissioning

This app employs three classes of users:

1. `Field users` can run published surveys.
2. `Staff users` have all the permissions of field users. They can also create, edit, and delete Agencies, Studies, Study Areas, Surveys, and Locations. They can publish surveys so they can be run by field users. Staff users can also view all collected data and design data visualizations on the collected data pages.
3. `Superusers` have all the permissions of staff users. They can also create, edit, and delete other users. Only superusers can set and change user passwords. **All superusers should also have staff status.**

## On form building
This app uses a custom fork of [django-fobi](https://github.com/datamade/django-fobi) for the Create Survey, Edit Survey, and Run Survey views. django-fobi's [documentation](https://django-fobi.readthedocs.io/en/0.13.8/) is an immensely helpful resource. Add-ons to the base are in this repo's `fobi-custom` folder, including custom plugins that draw from [`django-pldp`](https://github.com/datamade/django-pldp), our implementation of the Public Life Data Protocol.
